# Employee Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building and evaluating classification models to predict employee churn based on various employee characteristics. Employee churn (or turnover) is a critical metric for organizations, and accurately predicting which employees are at risk of leaving can help companies take proactive measures to retain talent.

The dataset contains features such as employee demographics, work experience, and job-related factors, which are used to train and evaluate machine learning models.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

## Data Importation and Exploration

The dataset is loaded using pandas and initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the data.

Various features are analyzed to identify trends and potential correlations that could influence employee churn.

## Data Preprocessing

Handling of missing values, categorical variable encoding, and feature scaling are performed to prepare the data for modeling.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure the models are evaluated on unseen data.

## Model Building
Several classification algorithms are implemented and trained on the dataset, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
  
Each model is tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve performance.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC score.

Confusion matrices and ROC curves are generated to provide visual insights into model performance.

## Model Comparison
A comparison of the models is conducted to determine which algorithm performs best in predicting employee churn.

The final model selection is based on a balance of model performance metrics and interpretability.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The findings from the model evaluations are summarized, and recommendations are provided on how to use the model in a real-world setting.

Suggestions for further improvements and potential next steps are discussed.

## Key Findings
### Feature Importance:

The analysis identifies key features that are most predictive of employee churn, such as job satisfaction, number of years at the company, and work-life balance.

## Model Performance:

The project demonstrates that ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines tend to outperform simpler models like Logistic Regression in terms of predictive accuracy.

However, Logistic Regression provides more interpretability, which could be important for understanding the underlying factors driving churn.
